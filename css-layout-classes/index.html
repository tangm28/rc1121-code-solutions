          <h2>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h2>
          <p>
            Super Smash Bros. Ultimate received universal acclaim from both
            critics and players, with some critics calling it the best
            installment in the series. It received praise for its large amount
            of content and fine-tuning of existing Smash gameplay elements,
            although its online mode was widely criticized.

          <h2>Donkey Kong</h2>
          <p>
            Donkey Kong[a] is a video game series created by Shigeru Miyamoto.
            It follows the adventures of an ape named Donkey Kong and his clan
            of other apes and monkeys. The franchise primarily consists of
            platform games, originally single-screen action puzzle games and
            later side-scrolling platformers. The first game was the 1981 arcade
            game Donkey Kong, featuring the homonymous character as the main
            antagonist in an industrial construction setting and the debut of
            both the Donkey Kong and Mario characters. The title was a massive
            success and was followed by two sequels released in 1982 and 1983.
            In 1994, the franchise was relaunched with the platformer Donkey
            Kong Country, in which Donkey Kong defeats a variety of
            anthropomorphic enemies, mainly the Kremlings, a clan of crocodiles
            led by King K. Rool who antagonize the Kongs by stealing their
            banana hoard.[1]
